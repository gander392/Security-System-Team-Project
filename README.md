# Team Project - Building Security System

Need to use the requirements process in the Head First book.

All files for this project should be committed to this repo.   

For each part commit one pdf - name it part1.pdf, part2.pdf, part3.pdf

For the time sheets name them lastname-Timelog.pdf.  Keep track of time for all three parts in the same spreadsheet.
